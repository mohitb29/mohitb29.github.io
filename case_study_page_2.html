                  <p>An online survey was conducted to gather information on the current form builder tools that users are using and their pain points with these tools.</p>
                  <li>Interviews</li>
                  <p>In-depth interviews were conducted with form builder users to understand their specific requirements and the features they expect from a form builder tool.                  </p>
                  <li>User Testing</li>
                  <p>User testing was conducted with a prototype of the form builder web application to gather feedback on the design and usability of the application.</p>
                </ol>
                <h5>Research Findings</h5>
                <p>Based on the research findings, the following were the key requirements of users for a form builder web application:</p>
